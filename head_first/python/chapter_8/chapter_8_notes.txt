Notes:
1. Context Management Protocol - Ex; with statment manages object contexts automatically in situations like file open and close.
2. Class = methods(a.k.a. functions) + attributes(a.k.a. variables)
	where they represent behavior and state respectively
3. Methods are shared between objects of the same class but not the variables
	ie. Objects share behavior but not state
4. NameError: Object doesn't exist or the scope is wrong
5. __repr__ returns the canonical string representation
   __init__ initializes the class when an object is created
